An exemplary integration of actor-based micro-services with `CQRS` and `Event Sourcing` 🆒 😎

- `akka` (typed),
- `akka-cluster`
- `akka-cluster-sharding`
- `akka-persistence` (Cassandra)
- `akka-projection` (Cassandra, Kafka)
- `akka-http` (gRPC)

Based on a template from [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/) and made during the [Akka platform guide tutorial](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-platform-guide/microservices-tutorial/index.html). Mostly a copy-🍝.
